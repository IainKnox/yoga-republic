# Yoga Republic

In this project I have created a new website for a fictional yoga studio set in the city of Glasgow. The name stems from the original idea of a yoga studio based in the *United* kindgom, this was then adapted to fit with Ci being based in the *Republic* of Ireland, hence the name **Yoga Republic**. The website is a designed to be of use to users who are new to yoga and are looking for more information as well as existing yoganistas looking for a local studio that aligns with modern day trends in ethos and value.

I approached this project with mobile first design principles to create a responsive webpage that is intended to look good and and perform well on any size of device. I have also put good user experience at the front and center of all designs and have strived to create an intuitive, informative and enjoyable journey for my users.

## User Stories

* I identified 2 groups of user for this site, firstly, users that are new to yoga and looking for more detailed information. Secondly, existing yoganistas who are looking to join a local community of practitioners.
    * ### New Users
        * Should be able to quickly gain an overview of what the studio is about via the landing page.
        * Should be able to see who the instructors are that lead the classes.
        * Should be able to see what classes are available at the studio.
        * Should be able to identify what level of experience is required to take a specific class.
        * Should be able to get detailed information on times classes are held.
        * Should be able to contact the studio and make a booking or find out further information.
        <hr>
    * ### Existing Users
        * Should be able to do all the above.
        * Should be able to gain an understanding of the core values of the studio.
        * Should be able to access social media platforms and engage with the broader community.
        <hr>
* From the above information I was able to determine what would be of considerable value when visiting the site and from that developed the following scope and goals:       

Yoga Republic is a yoga studio based in the Glasgow area, looking to create brand awareness and introduce potential members to the studio with hopes to expand its client base. Specific goals for the business are to offer a platfrom that will inform:
* the types of yoga on they offer 
* the times of the classes
* contact details and location of the studio
* call to action to get prospects to try out a class
* social media links to engage with the community
* _future goals are a platform to generate leads from site visitors_

Yoga Republic will be useful to users looking to find a specific yoga style suited to their fitness/ability level. Get detailed information on the various styles of yoga on offer and the teachers who lead the classes. See exactly when and where they need to be in order to join a class. Have access to an online form if they would like to be contacted directly by someone from the studio.

    * A further design element of the navbar is that it scrolls with the user as they navigate from the top down through a page, giving the user the flexibility to move on through the site without having to scroll back to the top.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    *  One of the key factors with the site is responsive design, and with the navbar this is carried through in the way in which it behaves on smaller screens, with it taking up 100% width and stacking for easier readability and an improved user experience that doesn't detract the focus away from the site.
    * ![Responsive Navigation](/assets/images/readme-img/nav-bar-responsive.png)
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <hr>

* #### Home Page
    * The home page starts with the hero image and is broken down into a further 3 sections. 
    * The welcome message gives a very concise message which helps to convey to the user what the site's main goal is and build on that in the form of the studios values and sense of community.
    * The about us cards act as a call to action to direct the user towards very specific goals, based on what is important to them. Whether that be the studios community, values or yoga teachings.The cards also portray this through the use of graphical icons. ![About Us Cards](/assets/images/readme-img/about-us-cards.png)

    <hr>

* #### Contact Us Page
    * The contact page again reinforces the call to action driven through the site, encouraging the user to get involved either by contacting the studio through traditional means such  as mail or phone, or through a sign up form. There is also a google map, allowing users to gain a physical sense of where the studio is located.

    * The form will allow the user to get signed up to Yoga Republic to start their mindfulness and fitness journey with the community. The user will be able specify if they would like to take part in the various activities offered at he studio. The user will be asked to submit their full name, email address and phone number.

    <hr>

* #### Footer
    * The footer container social media links that open a new browser window to the studio's Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages. There is also a floating "up" arrow to take users back to the top of the page without having to scroll up manually. The arrow was designed to incorporate the YR logo so as to help build brand awareness with the user as they navigate through the site, on a more subconscious level.
    * ![Footer](/assets/images/readme-img/footer.png)
    <hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Future Updates
* The studio would like to use the **Sign Up Page** to help generate future leads, collecting contact information from users to build a database of leads to follow up at later stage.
* The addition of an interactive calender to be able to check live class times and make an online booking.
* The addition of a blog section, to interact more actively with the community.
* A store page with the ability to prepay for booked classes, perhaps some branded merch such as yoga mats, sweat towels, water bottles, yoga clothing.

## Testing 1.0
Throughout this project I have done regular testing. And have reloaded and refreshed the pages multiple times after each addition and modification. 

My first round of testing was functionality testing in which I performed the following actions.
### Testing the Links
 * Checking the External Links such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter
 * Checking the External Links all Open in the new Tab
 * Testing Internal Links to About, Yoga and Contact, as well as the sub links such as #top
 <hr>

### Testing the Forms
 * Testing to see if the required fields are required
 * Testing the Submit Button
 <hr>

### Validator Testing

    * Validation results - [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)
    * All pages where tested through the W3C html validator and passed. Links to the results for each page are as follows;
        * [index.html Validation](https://iainknox.github.io/yoga-republic/documentation/index-html-validation.png)
        * [about.html Validation](https://iainknox.github.io/yoga-republic/documentation/about-html-validation.png)

        * [yoga-republic Validation](https://iainknox.github.io/yoga-republic/documentation/css-validation.png)
 <hr>

### Site fluidity 
To test the flow of the site I forwarded it on to my spouse and work colleagues. After some proding I asked for peer review within my P1 slack channel. Grammarly was also used to test the various pages for any spelling and grammar errors.
 <hr>

### Browser Compatibility
I tested the compatibility of my site first by by emulating different devices using the Dev tools in **Chrome** as well as using the variable responsive setting to check at different breakpoints. 
* The various tests that were run were:
    * checking to see if the all images and cards scaled and maintained aspect ratio as the display shrunk and grew.
    * checking to see if responsive elements within my layout changed at the correct breakpoints, such as the navbar and cards.
    * checking to see if my media queries behaved as expected with regards to cards displaying in columns or rows, navigation.  

I then tested it on different browsers. I have tested in **Chrome**, **Firefox** and **Edge**. Once I was sure my project worked on windows 10, I then opened it on my phone running **Safari** on **IOS 15**. 
 <hr>

## Testing 2.0
My second round of testing involved accessibility and readability, checking the live site against various industry standards such as Eightshapes and Webaim to ensure a well thought out UX and UI.

### Contrast Checker
* The first port of call with regards to contrast was [Eightshapes Contrast Grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23FFFFFF%2C%20White%0D%0A%23FFEFCA%0D%0A%23888888%0D%0A%23402E32%0D%0A%23000000%2C%20Black%0D%0A%2303011e%0D%0A%23303149%0D%0A%23CEA716%0D%0A%235F634F%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18) so as to best understand the contrast between all the elements of the site, ensure fonts were readable against backgrounds and that font sizing was consistent to maintain accessibility.
    * The resulting output was the following [Eightshapes - Yoga Republic](https://iainknox.github.io/yoga-republic/documentation/contrast-grid.png)
*   The site was tested using A11y colour contrast accessibility checker [Contrast Checker](https://color.a11y.com/Contrast/) to ensure maximum readability and accesibility.
    * [A11y - Yoga Republic](https://iainknox.github.io/yoga-republic/documentation/index-html-contrast-checker.png)
* The site was tested using WAVE, web accessibility evaluation tool [Webaim](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://iainknox.github.io/yoga-republic/index.html) to ensure accessibility criterea were met.
 <hr>

### Lighthouse Scores
*   The site was tested for both mobile and desktop scores via [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) with multiple tests being conducted. 
    * [index.html Lighthouse](https://iainknox.github.io/yoga-republic/documentation/index-html-lighthouse.png)
    * [about.html Lighthouse](https://iainknox.github.io/yoga-republic/documentation/about-html-lighthouse.png)
    * [yoga.html Lighthouse](https://iainknox.github.io/yoga-republic/documentation/yoga-html-lighthouse.png)
    * [contact.html Lighthouse](https://iainknox.github.io/yoga-republic/documentation/contact-html-lighthouse.png)
* For the most part pages consistently scored 100 for accessibility and SEO and high 90's for performance and best practices.

### AmIResponsive

* The site was tested with the amireponsive tool to determine how well it would look on various outputs. ![AmIReponsive](/assets/images/readme-img/amiresponsive.png)

## Deployment
I have hosted my site on github pages, it can be accessed from the following url:

https://iainknox.github.io/yoga-republic/

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


## Credits
* A big shout out to my mentor, **Reuben Ferrante**, for guding me through the process and offering assistance when neccesary to point me in the right direction.

* The community on **Slack**, the help and feedback a student is able to receive from the peers and alumni is a really invaluable tool to have.

* Finally it was suggested that I look into **Bootstrap** for help with regards to position and various design aspects. And while I found the resource to be of value, I thought it prudent to rather have built the code myself and in doing so add to my own knowledge and understanding or **HTML** and **CSS**.
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Content
* Much of the information regarding Yoga, its styles and origins where taken from various wikipedia articles [Yoga Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga)

* The color was inspired by running various searches through google with the keyword **Yoga** and then further refined with the help of sites such as [Color Space](https://mycolor.space/) and [Coolors](https://coolors.co/cea716-03011e-5f634f-303149-ffefca)

* The fonts were acquired via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Media
* The images used throughout the site were sourced from an open source gallery in Pexels. The [Yoga Studio Collection](https://www.pexels.com/collections/yoga-studio-m3q06x7/) was created with the features the studio offers in mind.

* The animation used on the landing page was inspired by the deisgn used in the **Love Running** project. It was modified to suit the needs of this site.

* Icons used throughout the site for social media and card graphics were sourced from the free kit made available on [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&p=2&q=social)
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Other Resources
* To better add to my understanding, markdown syntax was reseached from [Markdown Syntax](https://dotcms.com/docs/latest/markdown-syntax) to aid in compiling and styiling this README document :)

* While most programming happened at unsocialable hours, when I really got stuck the web is an invaluable resource too, I did a fair amount of review on [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) Concepts such as the **flip cards, sticky navigation** and **grid** all came from here.
