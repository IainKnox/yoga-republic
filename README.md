    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    *  One of the key factors with the site is responsive design, and with the navbar this is carried through in the way in which it behaves on smaller screens, with it taking up 100% width and stacking for easier readability and an improved user experience that doesn't detract the focus away from the site.

### Site fluidity 
To test the flow of the site I forwarded it on to my spouse and work colleagues. After some proding I asked for peer review within my P1 slack channel. Grammarly was also used to test the various pages for any spelling and grammar errors.
<hr>

### Browser Compatibility
I tested the compatibility of my site first by by emulating different devices using the Dev tools in **Chrome** as well as using the variable responsive setting to check at different breakpoints. 
* The various tests that were run were:
    * checking to see if the all images and cards scaled and maintained aspect ratio as the display shrunk and grew.
    * checking to see if responsive elements within my layout changed at the correct breakpoints, such as the navbar and cards.
    * checking to see if my media queries behaved as expected with regards to cards displaying in columns or rows, navigation.  

I then tested it on different browsers. I have tested in **Chrome**, **Firefox** and **Edge**. Once I was sure my project worked on windows 10, I then opened it on my phone running **Safari** on **IOS 15**.

## Credits
* A big shout out to my mentor, **Reuben Ferrante**, for guding me through the process and offering assistance when neccesary to point me in the right direction.
* The community on **Slack**, the help and feedback a student is able to receive from the peers and alumni is a really invaluable tool to have.

### Content
* Much of the information regarding Yoga, its styles and origins where taken from various wikipedia articles [Yoga Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga)

* The color was inspired by running various searches through google with the keyword **Yoga** and then further refined with the help of sites such as [Color Space](https://mycolor.space/) and [Coolors](https://coolors.co/e8c34a-1d1336-5f634f-9bc4cb-56e39f)

### Media
* The images used throughout the site were sourced from an open source gallery in Pexels. The [Yoga Studio Collection](https://www.pexels.com/collections/yoga-studio-m3q06x7/) was created with the features the studio offers in mind.

* The animation used on the landing page was inspired by the deisgn used in the **Love Running** project. It was modified to suit the needs of this site.

* Icons used throughout the site for social media and card graphics were sourced from the free kit made available on [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&p=2&q=social)
